        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a medium-sized gundog bred primarily for hunting.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The original Tollers were foxes. Canada's Micmac Indians observed foxes performing tolling behavior on
            the shores of rivers and lakes, then snatching the ducks foolish enough to come too close.</p>
